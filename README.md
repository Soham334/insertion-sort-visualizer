An interactive **Insertion Sort algorithm visualizer** built with **Next.js and React**, featuring real-time animations, configurable controls, and a modern UI.  
The project focuses on making algorithmic behavior observable rather than theoretical.

---

## 🔗 Live Demo
🚀 https://aoa1nsertion.vercel.app/

---

## 🧩 Problem
Sorting algorithms are often difficult to understand through theory alone.  
Insertion Sort in particular involves multiple comparisons and shifts that are hard to visualize mentally.

---

## 🚀 Solution
Built an interactive visualization system that:
- Dynamically renders array elements
- Animates comparisons and shifts step by step
- Allows users to control array size and animation speed
- Resets and regenerates data predictably

---

## ✨ Features
- Real-time insertion sort animation
- Adjustable array size
- Configurable animation speed
- Start, Reset, and New Array actions
- Clean, accessible UI components

## 🧠 Algorithm Analysis

| Metric | Complexity |
|------|-----------|
| Best Case | O(n) |
| Average Case | O(n²) |
| Worst Case | O(n²) |
| Space Complexity | O(1) |

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **shadcn/ui + Radix UI**
- **Framer Motion**
- **Vercel v0 (AI-assisted UI scaffolding)**
- **Vercel (deployment)**


---

## 📌 Engineering Highlights
- AI-assisted UI scaffolding using Vercel v0
- Manual implementation and refinement of insertion sort logic
- Clear separation between algorithm state and UI rendering
- Predictable animation lifecycle and reset behavior
- Production-ready Next.js configuration

## 🧾 Project Note
This project was assigned as a **group academic project**.  
However, **the complete development — algorithm logic, UI behavior, animations, and deployment — was done solely by me**.  
Group member names are retained in the UI for academic transparency.

---

## 🎯 What This Project Demonstrates
- Strong fundamentals in **Data Structures & Algorithms**
- Practical React and Next.js system thinking
- Responsible use of **AI-assisted development tools**
- End-to-end ownership from development to deployment
